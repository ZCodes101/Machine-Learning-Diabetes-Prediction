# Diabetes Prediction Analysis 

## Use machine learning to predict diabetes and embed the model on an interactive web page. 

- My motivation was to push the limits of what I truly know while solving a business problem.
- I built the project to test my strengths and weaknesses as a Software Engineer. This project includes machine learning, data science, software engineering, and full stack development to deliver an easy to use interactive and scalable web application. 
- It solves the problem of predicting the likelihood of someone developing diabetes. From a business perspective, you can use the results to target certain age or weight ranges for a specific service or product.
- Building this project reinforced the importance of APIs, interconnecting frameworks, and expanded my knowledge of software engineering, critical thinking and problem solving to integrate a business solution of current web design.
